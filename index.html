	<td>Earth's billions of inhabitants are unaware that the planet has an expiration date. With the warnings of an American scientist (Chiwetel Ejiofor), world leaders begin secret preparations for the survival of select members of society.<p> When the global cataclysm finally occurs, failed writer Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) tries to lead his family to safety as the world starts falling apart.</p></td>
	<td>

John Cusack as Jackson Curtis, a struggling writer and a father of two children. Chiwetel Ejiofor as geologist Adrian Helmsley, chief science advisor to the U.S. President. Amanda Peet as Kate Curtis, a medical student and Jackson's former wife.
</td>
<td>Sarita Robinson: Actually isn't a bad movie at all. Yes, the script is a little clunky and the dialogue is corny and there are some major stereotypical characters who are cliche, but overall it's pretty good. 

The pacing is a tad bit slow at the very beginning but once they get John Cusack in there and going, it picks up major momentum. Yes, the story is little unrealistic and incredible, but what movie with all that kind of action isn't a little unrealistic and incredible. The movie has good edge-of-the-seat moments that are predictable but still edgy none the less. </td>

	<td>Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto and his family have outsmarted and outdriven every foe in their path.

Fueled by revenge, a terrifying threat emerges from the shadows of the past to shatter Dom's world and destroy everything -- and everyone -- he loves.</td>
	<td>Vin Diesel plays Dominic Toretto.
Jason Momoa plays Dante Reyes.
Michelle Rodriguez plays Letty Ortiz.
Jason Statham plays Deckard Shaw.
Tyrese Gibson plays Roman Pearce.
Ludacris plays Tej Parker.

	<td>
Dylan Tant: This movie franchise has been around since before I was born. Iâ€™ve seen every movie at least 5 times, and not one has disappointed me. I love the fact that they use a variety of different vehicles from different places around the world. One thing that kinda bothers me is the fact that since Brian(Paul Walker, Rest In Peace) died, the movies seem as if the characters are more or less heroes than street racers. If universal studios could maybe town down on the heroic scenes and more street racing scenes, I would be beyond happy. But other than that, I highly recommend this series to car lovers!

	<td>After reuniting with Gwen Stacy, Brooklyn's full-time, friendly neighborhood Spider-Man is catapulted across the Multiverse, where he encounters a team of Spider-People charged with protecting its very existence. However, when the heroes clash on how to handle a new threat, Miles finds himself pitted against the other Spiders. He must soon redefine what it means to be a hero so he can save the people he loves most.</td>
	<td>There's Miguel O'Hara/Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac), the leader of this Spider Society. His right hand is Jessica Drew/Spider-Woman (Issa Rae), who shares the same superhero name as Gwen Stacy/Spider-Woman (Hailee Steinfeld).</td>

	<td>Poncemel Ardiente:
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse swings into action with a dazzling display of animation and a fresh take on the iconic web-slinger. Directed by Joakim Dos Santos, Justin Thompson and Kemp Powers, this sequel to the acclaimed "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" promises another exhilarating journey through the multiverse.

The movie picks up where the first installment left off, with Miles Morales navigating the challenges of being Spider-Man. However, a new threat emerges, leading Miles to embark on an interdimensional adventure that introduces us to new Spider-People and familiar faces from different realities.</td>
